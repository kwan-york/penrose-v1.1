# Project: My Website
This is a portfolio website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The current design is optimized for a desktop viewport.

My goal is to refactor the CSS and HTML to be fully responsive, following a mobile-first approach where practical.

**Instructions for the AI:**
- Refactor the navigation menu to use media queries. On screens with a max-width of 768px, hide the main links and display a hamburger icon that toggles a mobile menu.
- For the main content section, change the layout from a 3-column grid to a single-column layout on mobile devices.
- Ensure all images and videos are fluid and scale with the viewport size.
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layouts instead of floats.
